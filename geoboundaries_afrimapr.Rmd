Experimenting with geoboundaries for Africa, partly in response to Dave Kennedy via twitter .

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(afriadmin) # partly just to get at country list, also potential to compare with other boundaries
library(mapview)
library(knitr) #for kable
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("dickoa/rgeoboundaries")
library(rgeoboundaries)

```


```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

#' @param type character; defaults to HPSCU. One of HPSCU, HPSCGS, SSCGS, or SSCU. 
#'
#' * HPSCU - High Precision Single Country Unstadardized. The premier geoBoundaries release,
#' * HPSCGS - High Precision Single Country Globally Standardized. A version of geoBoundaries
#'   high precision data that has been clipped to the U.S. Department of State boundary file,
#'   ensuring no contested boundaries or overlap in the dataset. This globally standardized
#'   product may have gaps between countries. If you need a product with no gaps,
#'   we recommend our simplified global product.
#' * SSCU - Simplified Single Country Unstandardized. A simplified version of every file
#'   available for every country in the world. No standardization, maybe gaps. 
#' * SSCGS - Simplified Single Country Globally Standardized. A version of geoBoundaries
#'   simplified data that has been clipped to the U.S. Department of State boundary file,
#'   ensuring no contested boundaries or overlap in the dataset.
#'   This globally standardized product may have gaps between countries.


#test with a couple countries
sftest <- rgeoboundaries::geoboundaries(c("mali", "senegal"), adm_lvl = "adm0", type = "SSCGS")

#to get list of countries (from afriadmin)
data(afcountries)


sfafrica0 <- rgeoboundaries::geoboundaries(afcountries$name, adm_lvl = "adm0", type = "SSCGS")

# even this standardised one has some gaps for contested regions
# and doesn't have western sahara
mapview(sfafrica0)
