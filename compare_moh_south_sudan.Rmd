To compare moh data from South Sudan downloaded now with Kemri collated data from 2019.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(afrihealthsites)
library(knitr) #for kable
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```


```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ssudan_file <- "data-raw\\south_sudan_facility_info_2020-05-13.csv"

# test reading in file
dfssudan <- read.csv(ssudan_file, as.is=TRUE, check.names=FALSE)


#ssudan has a single location column
# fair few coords at null island 0,0
# seemingly some NAs, or maybe problem with me trying to pass single Location rather than 2 columns
which(is.na(dfssudan$Location))

sfssudan <- sf::st_as_sf(dfssudan, coords='Location')

dfs <- head(dfssudan)

sfssudan <- sf::st_as_sf(dfs, coords='Location')

```


```{r map_moh_ssudan, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# 9378 obs

# just view MoH data
sfmoh <- afrihealthsites("South Sudan", datasource=ssudan_file, lonlat_columns = "Location")

#testing filter
#sfmoh_tza <- afrihealthsites("Tanzania", datasource=tanzania_file, type_filter='Dispensary')
#filter with two types
#sfmoh_tza <- afrihealthsites("Tanzania", datasource=tanzania_file, type_filter=c('Dispensary','Health Center'))

#trying to remove one from selection doesn't work
#sfmoh_tza <- afrihealthsites("Tanzania", datasource=tanzania_file, type_filter='-Dispensary')
#sfmoh_tza <- afrihealthsites("Tanzania", datasource=tanzania_file, type_filter='!Dispensary')

# plot moh vs kemri on a map
compare_hs_sources("south sudan", datasources=c('who',ssudan_file))

# most overlap but not total

# moh data excludes zanzibar
# I added zanzibar into tanzania for kemri data

# todo 
# remove zanzibar from who for the comparison
# compare moh & who data, e.g. number locations of different categories


```

Plot counts of facility types from MoH data
```{r compare_type_frequencies, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, asis=TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=9}

#
ggtza <- facility_types("south sudan", 
                        datasource=ssudan_file,
                        type_column = "Facility Type",
                        lonlat_columns = c("Longitude", "Latitude"))
plot(ggtza)



```
